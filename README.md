# 📅 RUET Routine Management System

A **full-stack MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application for automating and managing class schedules at **Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET)**. This project modernizes the traditional, manual routine creation process by introducing an interactive, dynamic, and conflict-aware web-based platform.
