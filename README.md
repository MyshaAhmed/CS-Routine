# üìÖ RUET Routine Management System

A **full-stack MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application for automating and managing class schedules at **Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET)**. This project modernizes the traditional, manual routine creation process by introducing an interactive, dynamic, and conflict-aware web-based platform.

## üöÄ Features

### üìö Routine Structure & Constraints
- **Batches & Sections**: Supports all 4 academic years with Sections A, B, and C.
- **Room & Lab Management**:
  - 7 Classrooms: `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, `201`, `202`, `203`
  - 8 Labs: `HPCL Lab`, `PG Lab`, `OS Lab`, `NW Lab`, `SW Lab`, `HW Lab`, `ACL Lab`, `Mobile Apps Lab`
  - Labs have a max capacity of **30 students**
  - Labs(Even Code) can be held only on the 1st, 4th, and 7th periods
  - Lab classes will occupy 3 consecutive periods.

- **Time Constraints**:
  - Weekends: **Thursday & Friday** off
  - Breaks: `10:30 AM ‚Äì 10:50 AM` and `1:20 PM ‚Äì 2:30 PM`
  - Courses: 5 theory + multiple lab sessions (1.5 or 0.75 credit)
    
- **Real-time Conflict Detection**:
  - Duplicate teachers or rooms flagged in a **"Duplicates"** column
  - Duplicate input of a teacher or if the classes overlap in different rooms and sections, if such an entry is given, it will show a conflict
  - A teacher can have at most 2 classes a day, and it has to be in adjacent periods; otherwise, it will show a conflict
  - Lab classes(even code) must be taken at the 1st, 4th or 7th period. Lab classes will occupy 3 consecutive periods.
    
- **Teacher Constraints**:
  - A single teacher can take a maximum of 2 classes a day per section, and they must be **adjacent periods**
  - A single teacher can't take classes in different sections at the same period [time]. If such an entry is given, it will show a conflict.
    
- **Room Constraints**:
  - Two different classes can not be taken in the same room at the same time. If such an entry is given, it will show a conflict.

- **Seniority Sorting**:
  - Whenever a new batch entry is given, routine sorts in order: 4th year ‚Üí 3rd year‚Üí 2nd ‚Üí 1st

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Routine Management
>Routine Features:
![Features:](./assets/feature.png)

- **Add Batch Button**:
   - Adding a batch auto-generates rows for its 3 sections. Means adding a single batch will create a row for 3 sections (A, B, and C)

- **Seniority Sorting**:
  - Whenever a new batch entry is given, routine sorts in order: **4th year ‚Üí 3rd year‚Üí 2nd ‚Üí 1st**

- **Delete Batch Button**:
   - Deletes that particular batch from all days (SAT-WED).

![Delete Batch Action](./assets/delete-batch-btn.png) 

- **Edit Cell**:
   - When a single cell is clicked, an EditCell popup will show, where we can add cell information like `course code`, `teacher's name`, `room/lab` and also add additional rooms and teachers taking a single course.
   - The `Save button` saves the cell information.
   - The `Cancel button` cancels the operation and popup.
   - The `Delete Cell` button clears out cell data.

- **Print Routine**:
  - Full Routine can be printed upon clicking the Print Routine button

- **Routine Export (Download)**:
  - Export full routine as **PDF** upon clicking download button

  ![Download PDF Button](./assets/download-pdf-btn.png) 

- **Add Teacher**:
  - `Add teacher` button helps in **Teacher Management**, where we can add teacher information such as `Full name`, `Short Form`, `Designation`, `Department` and `University`.

  ![RT-Conflict](./assets/RT-conflict.png) 

  - A teacher can have at most 2 classes a day, and it has to be in adjacent periods; otherwise, it will show conflict

  ![cons-conflict](./assets/cons-entry.png) 

  - Lab classes(even code) must be taken at the 1st, 4th or 7th period. Lab classes will occupy 3 consecutive periods.  
  ![lab-conflict](./assets/lab-conflict.png) 
  
  - Conflict entries can be handled by deletion.

## üîß Future Enhancements
Features I plan to integrate in the future:
- **Secure Login / Authentication System** to manage access for admins, teachers, and students.
- The current app is built only for admins. I plan to create :
  - **Dedicated Teacher Dashboard**:  
    Provide a separate interface for teachers to:
    - Request available time slots for class tests (CT) or extra class.
    - View their personalized teaching schedules
  
  - **Student Portal**:  
    Enable a student-friendly view where students can:
    - Access the most up-to-date routine
    - Export or print schedules easily
