# üìÖ RUET Routine Management System

A **full-stack MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application for automating and managing class schedules at **Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET)**. This project modernizes the traditional, manual routine creation process by introducing an interactive, dynamic, and conflict-aware web-based platform.

## üöÄ Features

### üìö Routine Structure & Constraints
- **Batches & Sections**: Supports all 4 academic years with Sections A, B, and C.
- **Room & Lab Management**:
  - 7 Classrooms: `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, `201`, `202`, `203`
  - 8 Labs: `HPCL`, `PG Lab`, `OS Lab`, `NW Lab`, `SW Lab`, `HW Lab`, `ACL`, `Mobile Apps Lab`
  - Labs have a max capacity of **30 students**
- **Time Constraints**:
  - Weekends: **Thursday & Friday** off
  - Breaks: `10:30 AM ‚Äì 10:50 AM` and `1:20 PM ‚Äì 2:30 PM`
  - Courses: 5 theory + multiple lab sessions (1.5 or 0.75 credit)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Routine Management
- **Add Batch Button**:
   - Adding a batch auto-generates rows for its 3 sections. Means adding a single batch will create a row for 3 sections (A,B and C)
- **Delete Batch Button**:
   - Deletes that particular batch from all days (SAT-WED).
- **Edit Cell**:
   - When a single cell is clicked, an EditCell popup will show, where we can edit and add cell information like course code, teacher's name, room/lab and also add more teachers taking a single course.
   - "To clear information of a cell we need to manually clear the edit cell data and reenter new cell data, as delete cell feature is not yet implemented."
- **Real-time Conflict Detection**:
  - Duplicate teachers or rooms flagged in a **"Duplicates"** column
  - Duplicate input of a teacher or if the classes overlap at different rooms and sections, if such entry is given, it will show conflict
  - A teacher can have at most 2 classes a day and it has to be in adjacent periods, if not, it will show conflict
  - Lab classes(even code) must be taken at the 1st, 4th or 7th period. Lab classes will occupy 3 consecutive periods.  
- **Teacher Constraints**:
  - A single teacher can take max 2 classes a day per section, must be **adjacent periods**
  - A single teacher can't take classes at different sections at the same period [time]. If such entry is given, it will show conflict.
- **Room Constraints**:
  - Two different classes can not be taken in the same room at the same time. If such entry is given, it will show conflict.
- **Interactive Editing**:
  - Click on a routine cell to open a popup for editing
- **Routine Export (Download)**:
  - Export full routine as **PDF** upon clicking download button
- **Print Routine**:
  - Full Routine can be printed upon clicking Print Routine button
- **Seniority Sorting**:
  - Whenever a new batch entry is given, routine sorts in order: 4th year ‚Üí 3rd year‚Üí 2nd ‚Üí 1st
